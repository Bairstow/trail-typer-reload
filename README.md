# Trail Typer Reload

## Project Summary
After an initial spike to test some concepts for this project have decided to embark on a rewrite with lessons learnt.
The basic premise is a web-based practice typing application that will allow for live competition and stat tracking.

### Minor goals
- Keeping my frontend work present and relevant (especially, as is the case presently, where much of my other work is back end related).
- Toy around with some more of the popular libraries and build processes.
- Ship it :)
